# WayneWright

WayneWright is an automatic fixer wagon for Thunderbird. It helps you repair a small set of common problems without digging through hidden settings or long support threads. The add-on walks you through each change in plain language and only touches the areas it knows how to fix safely.

## What WayneWright does

- Checks for a small set of known, common Thunderbird issues
- Explains each proposed fix in clear, non-technical language
- Lets you choose which fixes to apply and which to skip
- Keeps changes focused and minimal so you stay in control
- Offers links to short help text when a manual tweak is better

WayneWright is an independent project and is not affiliated with the Thunderbird project.

## Installing WayneWright from GitHub (temporary sideload)

Right now WayneWright is shared as source code on GitHub. To try it in Thunderbird you can load it as a temporary add-on.

### 1. Download and extract the ZIP

1. Go to the WayneWright repository on GitHub.
2. Click the green **Code** button.
3. Choose **Download ZIP**.
4. Save the ZIP file and extract it to a folder on your computer.
   You should now see a folder that contains a `manifest.json` file.

### 2. Load the add-on temporarily in Thunderbird

1. Open **Thunderbird**.
2. In the menu bar, go to:  
   **Tools > Developer Tools > Debug Add-ons**.
3. In the **Debugging This Thunderbird** section, click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
4. In the file picker, navigate to the folder you extracted from the ZIP.
5. Select the `manifest.json` file and confirm.

Thunderbird will load WayneWright for this session. The add-on will disappear when Thunderbird restarts. To use it again, repeat the steps above and load `manifest.json` once more.

This flow is ideal for testing or previewing the add-on while it is under active development.

## Using WayneWright

After it is loaded, you can open WayneWright from the place the add-on integrates with Thunderbird (for example a toolbar button or menu entry, depending on your current build).

From there:

1. Run a check for supported issues.
2. Review the fixes that WayneWright suggests.
3. Choose which fixes to apply.
4. Let WayneWright do the work, or follow the provided steps if a manual change is better.

WayneWright will always try to explain what it is doing and keep changes small and focused.
